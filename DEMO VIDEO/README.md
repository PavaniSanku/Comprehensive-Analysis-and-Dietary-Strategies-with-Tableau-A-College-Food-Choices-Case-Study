📊 Project Overview
Comprehensive Analysis and Dietary Strategies with Tableau: A College Food Choices Case Study is an innovative data visualization project designed to improve student health and academic performance through informed dietary decision-making.

In today’s educational landscape, understanding the connections between dietary trends, nutrition, and health outcomes is essential. This project uses Tableau to build an interactive platform that visualizes data from student food choices, exercise habits, and health perceptions—turning raw data into actionable insights for institutions, health professionals, and students.

🎯 Project Goals
Visualize dietary and lifestyle data in an accessible and engaging format

Monitor nutrition trends in real-time and respond proactively

Identify and address deficiencies in student diets

Promote evidence-based, personalized nutrition strategies across campuses

📌 Real-World Scenarios
📉 Scenario 1: Monitoring Nutritional Intake
A sudden decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption is detected across multiple dining halls. Using Tableau dashboards, stakeholders can:

Quantify the drop across demographics or meal times

Explore potential causes, such as menu changes or awareness gaps

Launch targeted campaigns or modify dining options to reverse the trend

This enables real-time response to emerging health patterns.

🧪 Scenario 2: Addressing Dietary Deficiencies
Data shows high consumption of processed foods and low intake of essential nutrients like vitamins A and C. Health teams can:

Identify which student groups are most affected

Assess risks tied to these deficiencies

Implement targeted programs—like nutrition education or healthier vending machine options

With Tableau’s interactivity, interventions can be data-informed and measurable.

🔮 Scenario 3: Predictive Analytics & Personalized Nutrition
By analyzing historical data, universities can:

Forecast unhealthy dietary trends before they escalate

Identify at-risk students based on behavior patterns

Deliver personalized nutrition plans and support using predictive modeling

This fosters preventative care and long-term student wellness.
